# Lint & Type Check { #_top }

Ruff and pyright are both configured in `pyproject.toml`. Ruff runs with a broad rule set; pyright runs in `typeCheckingMode = "strict"` with `reportUnnecessaryTypeIgnoreComment = "error"` — dead suppressions are caught automatically.

Non-Python formatting is installed through uv alongside the development tools:

| Files    | Formatter                                    | Make target        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Python   | Ruff                                         | `make format`      |
| Markdown | mdformat with GFM/frontmatter/MkDocs support | `make format-md`   |
| TOML     | taplo                                        | `make format-toml` |
| YAML     | yamlfix                                      | `make format-yaml` |
| JSON     | pretty-format-json                           | `make format-json` |
| HTML     | djlint                                       | `make format-html` |
| CSS      | cssbeautifier                                | `make format-css`  |

`make format` runs all formatters; `make format-check` checks without rewriting
files. The formatters cover tracked and untracked non-ignored files, excluding
`uv.lock`, generated output and private work areas. Make, Git hooks and CI use the same
tools and configuration. The editor follows the same formatting conventions;
for JSON it uses Python's `json.tool`, while Make uses `pretty-format-json`.
Both preserve key order and Unicode, with two-space indentation. JSON formatting
applies to standard JSON; JSON with comments is not supported.

**Fix the root cause, do not silence warnings.**

## Auto-fix first

For ruff violations, run `make lint-fix` before editing by hand. The target uses Ruff's safe fixes. Review remaining suggestions and fix the underlying code; do not introduce ad hoc flags that weaken the checks.

## Suppression bans { #suppressions }

Never use any of the following to bypass a lint or type error without a strong, documented reason:

- `# noqa` / `# noqa: <code>` (ruff)
- `# type: ignore` / `# type: ignore[...]` (generic)
- `# pyright: ignore[reportX]` (pyright — preferred form when a pyright suppression is truly unavoidable, because it is rule-specific and pyright will flag it if it becomes unnecessary)
- `# pragma: no cover` (coverage — same discipline: only for code that legitimately cannot be executed in tests, not to hide untested paths)

## What counts as a strong, documented reason

One of:

- Known ruff or pyright bug with an upstream issue link.
- Third-party API whose typing or runtime behavior cannot be worked around (explain which API and why).
- Architectural trade-off already discussed and approved by the user.

## Suppression format — when one is truly justified

- Always use the **specific rule code** (`# noqa: E501`, `# pyright: ignore[reportUnknownMemberType]`), never a blanket form.
- Add an inline comment explaining **why** on the same line or the line immediately above.
- Prefer refactoring the code over suppressing the warning; suppression is the last resort.

## Config changes require escalation

Never modify `pyproject.toml` ruff or pyright rules unilaterally to make warnings disappear. This includes:

- `[tool.ruff.lint] select`
- `[tool.ruff.lint] ignore`
- `[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]`
- Any `report*` severity under `[tool.pyright]`

Raise the concern with the user first and only edit after explicit approval. Do not sprinkle suppressions across the codebase as a substitute for fixing the underlying issue.

## Verification gate after every edit

After each coherent change, run `make lint` and `make typecheck`; use `make check` for the complete gate before claiming completion. When the host provides diagnostic reminders, treat errors as blockers.

Use `make test-one TEST=tests/test_file.py::test_name` for focused test feedback.
This accepts one test file/node under `tests/`, not arbitrary pytest flags. It
does not replace `make check`, which still runs the full fast suite and coverage
threshold. For browser behavior changes, run `make test-e2e` separately against a fetched
Camoufox binary. The fast suite and `make check` exclude end-to-end tests.

taplo may format Python metadata through `make format`; uv may manage the
lockfile. These trusted tool outputs are allowed. Direct AI metadata rewrites
and unilateral changes to lint/type/coverage policy still require approval.

## Git hooks

`make setup` installs all dependencies through uv and three Git hook stages:

- `pre-commit` — `make lint-fix` for Python changes, `make format` for text
    changes including Markdown/YAML, and `make lock-check` when `pyproject.toml`
    or `uv.lock` changes.
- `pre-push` — `make check` and `make docs-build`. Formatting checks cover every
    supported language; the strict MkDocs build checks internal links and anchors.
- `commit-msg` — Conventional Commits format (the `type(scope): subject` rule
    from `AGENTS.md`), implemented in `scripts/hooks/check_conventional_commit.py`.

CI independently runs the checks on Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13, with the docs
build in the 3.13 job. Locally, `make typecheck` checks all three target versions;
`make test` runs the fast suite once in the selected interpreter with 80% branch
coverage. End-to-end browser tests remain a separate `make test-e2e` gate.

Local hooks provide earlier feedback and must also pass. Run `make setup` to
install/reinstall them and `make pre-commit` to exercise them on all files. If a
hook fails, diagnose its reported error. Never bypass it with `--no-verify`.
